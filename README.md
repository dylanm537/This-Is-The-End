# This Is The End

This Is The End? is a top to down survival shooter where you play as a lone survivor refusing to go down without a fight.
Trapped in a hostile arena overrun by zombies, you must survive as long as possible while enemies become faster, stronger, and more relentless.
Shoot, dodge, and outlast the undead assault every second alive increases your score.
